def anomaly_detector(stream, get_season_temp):
    '''
    Method for determining anomalies in the stream produced from the data_stream
    method. 
    
    Reason as to why this algorithm is efficient, clean, and accurate:
    This algorithm runs in linear time complexity, we know this because we iterate
    through our stream length once, iteratively. Looking at the space allocation and efficiency,
    this is very efficient through the use of constant data structures like a dictionary for fast lookups and insertions.
    Not only this, but its accurate and effective because we don't utilize the seasonal 
    dictionary to have fast lookup of a range of temperatures, from which we can determine 
    if the current tempurature is anomalistic due to bounds checking. On top of this, we add 
    a buffer value to avoid false positive data and focus on data points that truly are anomalies.

    Parameters:
        stream(array -> floats): Data stream fetched from the data_stream method.
        get_season_temp(tuple -> (int: int)): Tuple providing range of temperatures for given day in season.

    Returns:
        anomalies(dict -> int: array -> floats): Dictionary representing the
        anomalies of which occured in that year.
